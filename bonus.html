        <h2>6th grade</h2>
            <p>In 6th grade I basically had all my friends from 5th grade. I started off as a great year, which was what I expected. In the first semester I had straight A's. Around December, I made 2 absolutely great friends! Around the same time, I lost 2 friends. It was really sad because they were really good friends. I tried to not let it get in the way of grades and it didn't. As the end of the year approached, the friends I lost were coming back and so was I. It was friendships that couldn't stay on bad terms. I made a bunch of friends from different classes of course. These were only major events that happened in the year.</p>
        <h2>7th grade</h2> 
            <p>In 7th grade I had the same friends and made new ones too. My grades were great as well. I had all A's in the beginning but 2 of my A's turned into B's. I really didn't think much of it but I tried to get them up again. Later in the year, I lost 1 of my new friends and 2 of my older friends. It was rough but I still had more of my really close and awesome friends with me. Even later in the year I maintained a great GPA and attendence. I contributed to projects and completed my work. I always tried my best in classes. The year was coming to an end and was still on top of my academics.</p>
        <h2>8th grade</h2>
            <p>So far in 8th grade, my grades have been great. Algebra is challenging. It can be very simple one week but be so confusing the next. I am spending time on my work in algebra so I could understand it. I'm also in the FLA advisory ( Female Leadership Academy ). We are invloved in many school events. For example, for the Veteran's day assembly we made Christmas ornaments ( USA themed ) to hand out to the veteran's who come. I have gained friends and gotten closer with people due to this advisory and also from other classes. It is now quarter 2 and my grades are stable. I am trying my best to keep my grades the best they can be.</p>
