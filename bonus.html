        <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>Throughout my middle school years I have mastered skills I have had before. I even learned new skills. Outside of ATM I am great at working in groups or with a partner. I am good at collaborating and taking part in any projects or class activities. I find myself good at keeping track of my time and turning in assignment on time. I try to critique/improve my mistakes in essays or any assignments. Throughout my ATM years I have learned:</p>
            <ul> 
                <li>Photoshop</li>
                <li>Illustrator</li>  
                <li>Microsoft programs</li>
                <li>Code</li>
                <li>etc...</li>    
            </ul> 
        <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2> 
            <p>My hobbies and interests are pretty much the same. I love photography. I think it exposes your creativity and it's just really entertaining. I also like cooking/baking. I find it super fun and time consuming. I like finding new recipes to try. I also really enjoy dancing. When I was younger, I would do this type islander dancing. I would really like to get back into it.</p>
        <h2>My Family</h2>
            <p>I have 3 older sister and 1 younger brother. All together we are 5. My 2nd oldest sister had a baby in 2014 so I have a 3 year old niece. We always try to spend as much time togther as possible. We like to go to the mall, out to eat, to the movies, and to amusement parks! My mom and dad tag along sometimes but like to let us have time together. I don't see my cousins too often. Mostly, I see them a couple times a month and on holidays/birthdays.</p>
