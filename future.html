        <h2>My High School Choices</h2>
            <p>I'm not too sure on what high school I want or am going to but my choices are:</p>
            <img src="https://lh3.google.com/u/0/d/1ec4k6trhNhpmuwNxApU-7N42T2G3t-sP=w1366-h662-iv1" alt="a animated graduates cap" width="200">
            <ul> 
                <li>Lakewood</li>
                <li>Poly</li>    
            </ul> 
            <p>These are my main choices because they are both good schools. I have Poly there becuase a couple of my cousins go/went there. Also they have their PACE program which is really good. I have Lakewood their becuase I know many people who are going/went there. Also they have the Merit Scholars program, which is a good program, and they have DMAC, also a good program.</p>
        <h2>College</h2> 
            <p>I'm still not sure what I want to do for my career but I have time. My college choices are still not decided either. I know for sure that I want to go to a University. If I'm still not sure what I want as a career, I will go to a city college and transfer out or just finish my years and start again at a University.</p>
        <h2>Career Interests</h2>
            <p>My career interests are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Photographer</li>
                    <li>Planner (weddings, birthdays, etc...)</li>
                    <li>Interior Design</li>
                </ul>
            <p>I'm interested in photography because it expresses your creativity. It is also time consuming and entertaining. I would also want to be a event planner because I always liked to be in control of things. I could decorate everything with how I think looks good but also abide by the rules and theme I am given. Lastly, I would want to do interior design. I think this is absolutely one on my fovorites becuase this is where people live and call homes. I could also express my creativity with the decor and furniture of course with abiding with the theme given. Overall, I would want a job that expresses my creativity. 
        <h2>My Goals</h2> 
        <p>My goals from present time to my future is:</p>
