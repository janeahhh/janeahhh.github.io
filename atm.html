        <h2>About ATM</h2>
            <p>ATM stands for Applied Technology Magnet. Throughout your 3 years you learn different things. In your 6th grade you learn the simple basics. In 7th grade you start learning harder things like photo editing programs. Finally in 8th grade, you learn much more complicated things like code.</p>
         <h2>6th grade</h2>
            <p>In 6th grade we went slow and worked on simple programs. This was to get us used to the comuter.</p>

            <p>In 7th grade it got more challenging. It was a way different level of difficulty from 6th grade.</p>

         <h2>ATM Reflection</h2> 
          <p>Being in the program ATM is a very good oppurtunity and it's also very fun. My absolute favorite part was learning photoshop and all of the photo editing programs. Coding is also very interesting. It can get very complicated at times but I know that I have sources to go back to. I also like how I got to make new friends. Although I don't see myself associated with computers in the future, I do find knowing how to do different things on a computer very important and handy.</p>
